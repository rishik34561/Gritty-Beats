UPDATE: This repository now only contains the code for the backend Python API used by the Guess the Song application, which is linked below. 

Project URL: https://gritty-beats-react.herokuapp.com/

This web application is a game in which users can choose a genre of music and are then provided with an audio sample of a random song pulled using the Billboard API. The player is then given four possible options from which to choose the correct song from, and his/her score will change based on whether the answer is correct or not.
